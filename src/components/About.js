      <p>
        As a recent full-stack java developer boot camp graduate, I was voted
        most likely to "show up early" and most likely to "become a technical
        trainer" by my fellow learners. The experience was enriching and I
        enjoyed helping others with any concept they struggled with or just
        collaborating on implementing a more efficient solution.

        I was successful in my previous career as a pet stylist, where I learned
        how to thrive in a busy fast-paced environment and the importance that a
        positive attitude plays in creating a pleasant work atmosphere. The most
        rewarding aspect of my role was devising clever solutions to overcome
        day-to-day obstacles.

        I have a solid foundation in time management and communication, which
        are invaluable skills that I believe are necessary to be successful in
        any position. My curiosity and passion for self-directed learning aid me
        in learning new technologies as the interest or need arises.
